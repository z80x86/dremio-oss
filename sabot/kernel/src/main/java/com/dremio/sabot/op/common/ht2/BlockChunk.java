/**
 * This class represents the information required to do the hash computation
 * for vectorized hash agg and hash join operators when inserting the pivoted
 * data into the hash table. It encapsulates the information about pivot space,
 * target address for storing the hashvalues (since we compute hash for entire
 * batch at one go), seed for hash. Seed is needed here since with spilling
 * feature the operator controls the hashing (and partitioning) so it decides
 * the appropriate seed.
