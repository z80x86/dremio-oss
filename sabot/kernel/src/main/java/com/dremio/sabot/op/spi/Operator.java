 * The base unit of Execution. An operator is expected to consume one or more

 * a set of MasterStates that describe what the operators status is.
 *
 * There are four main operators types, that expose one of or both of two main operator subtypes. They are as follows:
 *
 * - DualInputOperator (Producer): Examples include HashJoinOperator, UnionOperator.
 * - SingleInputOperator (Producer, SingleConsumer): Examples include FilterOperator, SortOperator
 * - ProducerOperator (Producer): Examples include ScanOperator, UnorderedReceiverOperator
 * - TerminalOperator (SingleConsumer): Examples include SingleSenderOperator, ScreenOperator
