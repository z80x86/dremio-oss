/**
 * This is a marker interface that represents a handle to a dataset.
 * <p>
 * Implementations typically hold onto some context (state) about the dataset being requested, so that when callers use
 * this handle to invoke other metadata API, more expensive operations can be performed.
 * <p>
 * For example, the entity path will be held as state.
 * <p>
 * Another example, when iterating over dataset handles using {@link SupportsListingDatasets#listDatasetHandles list handles
 * API}, a concrete implementation may hold onto a table name and driver connection (in turn, held inside the iterator),
 * and on invoking {@link SourceMetadata#getDatasetMetadata dataset metadata API}, the state in the handle is
 * used to get {@link DatasetStats} about that dataset from the source.
 * <p>
 * Note that the state held by implementations must have a small memory footprint.
